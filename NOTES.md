# Developer Notes

Guidelines
----------

- Methods that return something should have the attribure `Pure`. It is not
  mandatory but it clearly states that the result should not be ignored.
  It might seem superfluous, but "Ã§a ne mange pas de pain".
- Add _nullable annotations_ whenever necessary.
- _Seal classes_ unless they are designed with extensibility in mind.
- Tag any use of the null-forgiving operator (!) with `BONSANG!`.

TODOs
-----

See `FIXME`, `TODO` and `REVIEW` within the code and:
- Tests & code coverage (coverlet). Currently, there are many cases where we
  don't go beyond smoke tests.
- XML comments with complete examples.
- Perf tool (LINQ, nulls).
- Optimize LINQ ops.
