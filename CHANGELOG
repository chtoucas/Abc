Changelog for Abc.

vNEXT
-----

Removed
- Maybe<T>.Join(); use Maybe<T>.SelectMany() instead.
- Explicit structural comparisons for Maybe<T>. The default equality and order
  comparisons are already structural. I don't think that we need to implement
  the structural comparison interfaces.

2020-04-03, version 1.0.0-alpha-2
---------------------------------

Changed
- Async methods now use eager validation.
- Maybe<T>.OrElseAsync() now expects a factory rather than a task.
- Maybe.Compose() and Maybe.ComposeBack() now return a "maybe" rather than
  an anonymous function.
- The NuGet package now includes the pdb.

Removed
- Maybe<T>.GroupJoin(); use Maybe<T>.SelectMany() instead.
- Maybe<T>.SwitchAsync(); use Maybe<T>.Switch() instead.
- Qperators.ZipAny(); use LINQ Zip followed by Maybe.CollectAny().

Internals
- Full test coverage.
- Replaced OpenCover by coverlet as the default tool for test coverage.
- New project Narvalo.Future for experimental code.
- Cleaned up project files.
  * No longer define compiler symbols NETSTANDARD2_0 and NETSTANDARD2_1 as
    this is already done by MSBuild.
    See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/libraries
  * Use .editorconfig instead of MSBuild to configure language conventions
    inside the editor (warnings IDEnnnn).
